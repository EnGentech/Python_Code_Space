        <ul>
            <li><b>&lt;Blockquote&gt; element</b>
                <p>
                    In HTML, the &lt;blockquote&gt; element is used to represent a block of text that is a quotation from another source. It's a block-level element, meaning it typically starts on a new line and takes up the full width of its containing element. The purpose of &lt;blockquote&gt; is to provide a semantic way of indicating quoted content, such as excerpts from books, articles, or other written works. for example
                    <blockquote>
                        "The only way to do great work is to love what you do." - Steve Jobs
                    </blockquote>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><b>&lt;Pre&gt; element</b>
                <p>
                    In HTML, the &lt;pre&gt; element, which stands for "preformatted text," is used to define text that should be 
                    presented exactly as it appears in the HTML code. This element is particularly useful when you want to display code 
                    snippets, ASCII art, or any content where whitespace, line breaks, and indentation are crucial and should be preserved.
                    <pre>
                        I want this lines of text to be displayed
                        exactly as I am formating it.     !
                    </pre>
	            </p>
            </li>
            <li><b>&lt;fieldset&gt; element</b>
                <p>
                    The &lt;fieldset&gt; element in HTML is used to group related elements within a form and create a visual and semantic container for them. It is often used in conjunction with the &lt;legend&gt; element to provide a title or description for the grouped content. The primary purpose of &gt;fieldset&gt; is to improve the organization and accessibility of form controls. for example
                    <fieldset>
                        <center><strong> inciting Story to becoming a web developer</strong></center>
                        <p>
                            In a world of web development, Alex, fueled by passion, set out to create a sleek website. With HTML, the structure took form—header, nav, main, and footer. CSS added style, using flexbox for layout and media queries for responsiveness.

                            But Alex craved more than static visuals. Enter JavaScript—the magic wand. Buttons animated on hover, an image carousel in motion, and a form that validated input. The code transformed into a masterpiece.

                            Deployed to the web, the site wowed users. Alex smiled, for the short story of coding had become a tale of innovation, perseverance, and the joy of bringing ideas to life online. And so, the web development journey continued, with Alex always  seeking new adventures in the digital realm.

            </li>
            <li><b>&lt;address&gt; element</b>
                <p>
                    In HTML, the &lt;address&gt; element is used to define the contact information for the author or owner of a document, or for the person or organization referenced in the content. The content inside the &lt;address&gt; element typically includes contact details such as physical address, email address, phone number, etc. for example
                    <p>Red-river college is located at</p>
                    <address>
                        2280 Saskatchewan Avenue, Winnipeg, Manitoba, R3J 0R9 <br>
                        160 Princess Street, Winnipeg, Manitoba, R3B 1K9
                    </address>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><b>&lt;nav&gt; element</b></li>
            <p>
                In HTML, the &lt;nav&gt; element is used to define a navigation section on a web page. It is a block-level element that is intended to contain links to other pages, sections within the same page, or other resources that help users navigate through the website. The &lt;nav&gt; element is particularly useful for marking up the main navigation menu of a site.
                <nav>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
                        <li><a href="#about">About Us</a></li>
                        <li><a href="#services">Services</a></li>
                        <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
                    </ul>
                </nav>
            </p>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li><b>&lt;Span&gt; element</b>
                <p>
                    The &lt;span&gt; element in HTML is a generic inline container that doesn't have any inherent semantic meaning. It is primarily used to apply styles or scripting to a specific portion of text within a larger block of content. Unlike block-level elements (e.g., <div>), which create a distinct block of content on the page, &lt;span&gt; is an inline element that doesn't introduce a line break and only takes up as much width as necessary. <br>for example
                    <p>My name is Precious, I love <span style="color: red">Red color</span></p>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>&lt;u&gt; element</b>
                <p>
                    The &lt;u&gt; element in HTML is used to define and render text with an underline. It is traditionally associated with underlining text, making it visually distinct. However, the use of &lt;u&gt; for underlining text is considered somewhat outdated in modern web development. for example <br>
                    <p><u>Web Development</u> is a lucrative tech skill</p>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>&lt;a&gt; element</b>
                <p>
                    The &lt;a&gt; tag in HTML is used to create hyperlinks, allowing users to navigate to other web pages or resources. The "a" in &lt;a&gt; stands for "anchor," and it's often referred to as the "anchor element." for example <br>
                    <h5>Links to social medias</h5>
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">Youtube</a> <br>
                    <a href="https://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a><br>
                    <a href="https://www.instagram.com/">Instagram</a>
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
